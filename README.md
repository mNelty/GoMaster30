# GoMaster 30

GoMaster 30 is a simple learning website designed to help you practice and improve your Go (Golang) skills with 30 minutes/day.

## What GoMaster 30 Is

GoMaster 30 is **not** a course and does **not** provide step-by-step lessons or long explanations.

Instead, each day it gives you:
- **What you will do today** – a clear daily goal
- **Helpful sources** – links to documentation, articles, or references
- **An example** – a small, practical example to guide you

The learning happens by **reading, exploring, and coding on your own**.

## What GoMaster 30 Is Not

- ❌ No video lessons  
- ❌ No detailed tutorials  
- ❌ No hand-holding  

You are expected to be proactive and curious.

## Who It’s For

GoMaster 30 is for developers who:
- Want to learn Go by doing
- Prefer self-directed learning
- Are comfortable reading documentation and experimenting

## How It Works

1. Visit the website
2. Open today’s task
3. Read the goal
4. Check the provided sourceswd
5. Study the example
6. Write your own code

Repeat every day for 30 days.

## Goal

By the end of GoMaster 30, you should be more confident reading Go code, writing your own programs, and learning independently.

Happy coding 🚀

### Important Note

GoMaster 30 will not miraculously teach you Go. It is **not a professional** application. It is simple a guide for basic beginners.
